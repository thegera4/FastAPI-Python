# FastAPI-Python
This is a simple REST API made with Python to practice FastAPI along with some other technologies.

You can visit https://fastapi-docker-example-production.up.railway.app/docs to test the endpoints of this API. 
When you visit the page, you are automatically redirected to the documentation page (Swagger) which is one of the biggest benefits (and my favorite) of using fast API over other backend frameworks(the documentation is created automatically for you!).

This application was also Dockerized and uploaded to the docker hub. You can see the image, download it, and use it from: https://hub.docker.com/r/thegera4/fastapi-example

Finally, the app uses a MongoDB to store data.

The app was deployed in railway as a docker container, fast and easy!
